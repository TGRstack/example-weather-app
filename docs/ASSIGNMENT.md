# Weather App

Write a weather app in React that will allow a user to pick a location by entering a zip code, and display a five-day forecast for that location. Clicking on any day in the five-day forecast will change the display to show details about that day â€” it is left for you to decide which details to display, but those could include an hourly forecast, wind and precipitation information, etc. There should also be a way to navigate back to the five-day forecast and select a different day.
The forecast is automatically refreshed every five minutes.

- [x] user enters zip code to add a city
- [x] home renders the current weather and five-day forecast for the city
- [ ] details per day
- [ ] data refreshes every 5 min

## Stretch goal 1

Allow a user to select a list of locations, rather than just one. The user should be able to add a new location, delete an existing one, and change the order of the list.

## Stretch goal 2

Do not use a CSS framework such as bootstrap or foundation, but rather write your own CSS.
Please submit what you would consider testable and maintainable production code. The code must compile and run on my local machine. **It must contain some sort of positive and negative tests**, proving that it works as expected, and it must be well-documented. If the statement of the problem is unclear, feel free to make assumptions, but please state your assumptions in the solution. Pay attention to user experience and usability.
